# Robworks Claude Code Plugins

A personal [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) plugin marketplace authored by Ryan Robson and [Robworks Software LLC](https://robworks.info).

**Web catalog:** <https://code.robworks.info/plugins/> — live view of the plugins below, rendered directly from `marketplace.json` at runtime. The catalog page is part of [code.robworks.info](https://code.robworks.info), the portfolio for Ryan Robson and Robworks Software LLC.

A **marketplace** is a catalog of plugins you can install into Claude Code. Adding this marketplace to your Claude Code installation lets you discover, install, update, and remove any of its plugins with a single command.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart) (any recent version — plugin support is GA as of 2025)
- Git access to public GitHub (no token required to install from this public marketplace)

## Add the marketplace

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add robworks-code/robworks-claude-code-plugins
```

This clones the catalog into `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/` and registers it under the name `robworks-claude-code-plugins`. Plugins themselves are only downloaded on install.

Inside an interactive Claude Code session, you can use the slash-command equivalent:

```
/plugin marketplace add robworks-code/robworks-claude-code-plugins
```

## Browse and install plugins

```bash
# List what's available in this marketplace
claude plugin list

# Install a specific plugin
claude plugin install <plugin-name>@robworks-claude-code-plugins

# Install at a specific scope (user | project | local)
claude plugin install <plugin-name>@robworks-claude-code-plugins -s user
```

Inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin install <plugin-name>@robworks-claude-code-plugins
```

## Available plugins

<!-- BEGIN:PLUGINS-TABLE -->
| Plugin | Category | Description | License | Pinned | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`ga-mcp-full`](https://github.com/ringo380/ga-mcp-full) | analytics | GA4 MCP server with full Admin API read/write access — bundled with Claude Code auth helpers and SessionStart bootstrap. | `MIT` | `v0.5.0` |  |
| [`claude-quikgif`](https://github.com/ringo380/claude-quikgif) | productivity | QuikGIF MCP integration for Claude Code — bundled MCP shim, session-start update notices, and lifecycle slash commands (status, install, update, install-mcp). | `MIT` | `v0.2.0` |  |
| [`namecheap-mcp`](https://github.com/ringo380/namecheap-mcp) | infrastructure | Namecheap MCP server — manage domains, DNS, SSL, transfers, and account from Claude Code. Includes a guided /namecheap-mcp:setup command for first-run credentials. | `MIT` | `v1.5.0` |  |
| [`appstore-connect-mcp`](https://github.com/ringo380/appstore-connect-mcp) | developer-tools | App Store Connect MCP server. Query 923 API endpoints and run authenticated calls — apps, reviews, sales reports, TestFlight, beta testers, and more. | `MIT` | `v2.2.3` |  |
| [`xcode-mcp-server`](https://github.com/ringo380/Xcode-mcp-server) | developer-tools | Xcode MCP server — build projects and run tests from Claude Code with structured output, log persistence, and Xcode 15/16+ compatibility. | `MIT` | `v1.0.0` |  |
| [`cpanel-mcp`](https://github.com/ringo380/claude-cpanel-mcp) | infrastructure | cPanel UAPI MCP server - 74 tools for email, DNS, file read and write, MySQL, FTP, SSL, cron, subdomains, addon domains, and backups on shared cPanel hosting. Multi-account profiles with atomic token rotation, dry-run auth_test, cPHulk lockout detection, POST routing that keeps secrets out of the cPanel access log, and a state-machine /cpanel-mcp:setup. | `MIT` | `v0.4.4` |  |
| [`ableton`](https://github.com/ringo380/ableton-mcp-max) | creative | Drive Ableton Live 11 and 12 from Claude Code on macOS and Windows - tracks, clips, MIDI notes, devices, mixer, automation, arrangement, scenes, transport, stem import, Ozone mastering, and preset generation (Wavetable, Simpler, rack macros & zones, and macro->parameter mappings) over a bundled MCP server. Includes a guided /ableton:setup, a /ableton:analyze best-practice set report, plus workflow commands for building and editing tracks. | `PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0` | `v0.35.1` |  |
| [`notation`](https://github.com/Robworks-Code/notation) | productivity | Capture session learnings into the right Claude Code memory tier instead of dumping them all into CLAUDE.md. /notation:notate reads the session, right-sizes the flow, and presents proposals as a scorecard plus per-tier tables with diffs; /notation:notate-all applies them without the picker; /notation:feedback sends a bug or routing correction to the maintainer. The bundled notation-audit skill keeps the global CLAUDE.md under its size budget, relocating detail into linked topical notes rather than deleting it. Project-scoped and global-scoped memory are kept independent: a learning that stops being true in another repo goes to that project's memory or docs, never into your global notes, and the audit reports the two scopes separately. Backups are sorted by kind rather than lumped together: a run's own rollback copies are offered for cleanup once its verification passed, while your own CLAUDE.md snapshot history is reported and left alone - and a rotation policy of your own always wins. Capture measures rather than guesses: every proposal is priced in characters before anything is written, a whole-run budget check catches additions that are each individually fine but collectively too large, and after the writes land it re-measures and reports any edit that did not land as drafted - telling that apart from a file another session changed underneath it. Notation is additive: it preserves existing lines and dates new entries rather than overwriting history. | `MIT` | `v0.12.0` |  |
| [`deep-review`](https://github.com/Robworks-Code/deep-review) | developer-tools | Multi-agent pull request review that surfaces every finding instead of hiding low-confidence ones. /deep-review:review scores each issue on confidence and severity, verifies impactful-but-uncertain ones, then presents a two-axis triage in-session and posts to the PR on confirm. /deep-review:auto double-checks then auto-applies a fix for every issue to the working tree, runs the repo's local gate to verify them, and confirms every fix survived the run. Works with or without a PR, tolerates a dirty tree without touching unrelated uncommitted work, and never assumes CI exists. | `MIT` | `v0.3.1` |  |
| [`colab`](https://github.com/robworks-code/colab-mcp-extended) | developer-tools | Drive Google Colab from Claude Code over a bundled MCP server — open Drive notebooks, run code in the kernel, manage multiple sessions, upload/download VM files, mount Drive, read Colab secrets, inspect variables, edit notebook cells, and run fine-tune round-trip + local MLX conversion helpers. Optional headless/Playwright backend. Includes guided /colab:setup and /colab:help commands. | `MIT` | `v1.3.0` |  |
| [`sharding`](https://github.com/robworks-code/sharding) | developer-tools | Develop a product as isolated shards coupled only through a frozen, versioned contract, with drift caught mechanically. A Claude Code plugin plus a deterministic engine: SessionStart/PreToolUse/Stop hooks sandbox each shard to its own slice and a read-only contract, and /shard-* commands diff a shard's surface against the contract and gate phases. /shard-orchestrate plans the shards into dependency waves and can drive a real headless Claude Code session per shard, each confined to its own directory and a read-only contract, then re-reads every surface from disk to decide the verdict. | `MIT` | `v0.0.9` |  |
| [`audacity`](https://github.com/robworks-code/audacity-mcp-max) | developer-tools | Drive Audacity from Claude Code - 132 tools plus one-call cleanup and mastering pipelines, with guided setup and diagnostics. | `Apache-2.0` | `v0.3.0` |  |
| [`icloud-mcp`](https://github.com/robworks-code/icloud-mcp) | productivity | MCP server for iCloud Drive that works whether or not files are synced locally: list, search, read, download, upload, write, mkdir, rename, move, trash, and restore. iCloud is the source of truth; a hydrated local copy is used for reads when present. Needs uv and a one-time icloud-mcp login. | `MIT` | `v0.1.0` |  |

*More plugins land here as they're published. The table above is regenerated by `scripts/build-readme.js` — run it after any `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` change. The web catalog rebuilds itself automatically (it fetches `marketplace.json` from this repo at runtime).*

## Manage installed plugins

```bash
claude plugin list                                            # Show all installed plugins
claude plugin update <plugin>@robworks-claude-code-plugins    # Pull the latest version
claude plugin enable <plugin>@robworks-claude-code-plugins    # Re-enable a disabled plugin
claude plugin disable <plugin>@robworks-claude-code-plugins   # Disable without uninstalling
claude plugin uninstall <plugin>@robworks-claude-code-plugins # Remove the plugin
```

## Refresh the catalog

When new plugins are added or versions change in this marketplace, pull the latest catalog:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update robworks-claude-code-plugins
```

## Pinning to a release

Each plugin entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` can pin to a branch, tag, or exact commit:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "ga-mcp-full",
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "ringo380/ga-mcp-full",
    "ref": "v0.3.1"           // tag or branch
    // or "sha": "abc123..."   // 40-char commit SHA for exact pin
  }
}
```

Without a pin, the marketplace tracks the default branch of each plugin repo.

## Require this marketplace for your team

Add to a project's `.claude/settings.json` so teammates are prompted to trust it on first open:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "robworks-claude-code-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "robworks-code/robworks-claude-code-plugins"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "ga-mcp-full@robworks-claude-code-plugins": true
  }
}
```

See the [Claude Code plugin settings docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#plugin-settings) for all options.

## Repo layout

```
robworks-claude-code-plugins/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json   # The catalog — edit to add/update plugins
├── scripts/
│   └── build-readme.js    # Regenerates the table above from marketplace.json
└── README.md              # This file
```

There is no plugin code in this repo — every plugin is hosted in its own external GitHub repo and pulled in via a `github` source reference. That keeps plugin development, versioning, and releases decoupled from the marketplace catalog itself.

The web catalog (formerly served from `docs/` here) lives in [`ringo380/robworks-code`](https://github.com/ringo380/robworks-code) and fetches `marketplace.json` from this repo at runtime — so adding a plugin here updates the live site within ~5 minutes (raw.githubusercontent.com CDN cache) without any deploy step.

## Contributing a plugin

Want me to catalog one of your plugins here? Open an issue or PR:

1. Build your plugin in a public GitHub repo with a valid `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest.
2. PR this repo with a new entry in `plugins[]` of `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, then run `node scripts/build-readme.js` to regenerate the table above.
3. I'll review for fit (currently: MCP servers, useful agents/skills, and dev workflow plugins).

Private or internal plugins — roll your own marketplace by forking this repo.

## Troubleshooting

### `claude plugin marketplace add` hangs or times out

Git operations default to a 120s timeout. Bump it for slow networks:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_GIT_TIMEOUT_MS=300000  # 5 minutes
claude plugin marketplace add robworks-code/robworks-claude-code-plugins
```

### Plugin install fails with authentication errors

For public plugins (everything here), no token is needed. If you still see auth errors:

```bash
gh auth status                 # Are you logged into GitHub at all?
git config --global credential.helper   # Is a credential helper configured?
```

Auto-updates use `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` env vars when set. Only needed for private marketplaces.

### Marketplace shows stale plugins after an update

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update robworks-claude-code-plugins
claude plugin update <plugin>@robworks-claude-code-plugins
```

If an individual plugin reports the same version twice in a row, the plugin author needs to bump its `plugin.json` version — the cache keys on the manifest version.

### I need to restrict which marketplaces are addable in my org

See [`strictKnownMarketplaces`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#strictknownmarketplaces) in managed settings. Allowlist this repo with:

```json
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "robworks-code/robworks-claude-code-plugins" }
  ]
}
```
